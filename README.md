# Weather App

This project is a local weather-app for my hometown Sollefte√•.

## The problem

I started collecting the data from the API and displaying the data in proper way.
Then I did some styling. I wish I had more time to put in this week, but I didn't. If I had more time I would have had the backgrounds changing depending on the temperature. And I also had plans on having local pictures of my town in different weathers as a header-background.
